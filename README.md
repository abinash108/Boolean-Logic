# HDL-Based Boolean and Arithmetic Circuit Design
This repository explores the design, simulation, and synthesis of basic boolean and arithmetic circuits using a Hardware Description Language (HDL).

# Project Scope
This project focuses on:

- Implementing fundamental boolean logic circuits like AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and their combinations.

- Designing basic arithmetic circuits like adders, subtractors, and comparators.
- Designing some basic combinational circuits like mux, decoders , PROMS
- Writing HDL code to represent these circuits for simulation and synthesis.
- Simulating the circuits to validate their behavior for various input combinations.
- Synthesizing the HDL code to generate a netlist or hardware representation of the circuits.
Learning Objectives
By working on this project, you will gain:

- Understanding of HDL syntax and semantics for describing digital circuits.
- Practical experience in building boolean and arithmetic circuits using HDL.
- Ability to simulate circuits to verify their functionality.
- Insights into logic synthesis and its role in hardware design.
